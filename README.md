# The PokeVerse App v1

## App Description

This application is designed for users ("trainers") to be able to store their pokemon collections via a searchable and browsable database. In Version 1.0 we include the original 150 pokemon and the ability to save your collection and share it via social media. In later versions, we hope to implement trainer "levels" and a trading and game aspect

## Installation Instructions

Clone this repo locally. Copy the appsettingsTEMPLATE.json to a file called appsettings.json. Update your connection string to point to your local database. Register your site with google here [here](https://https://www.google.com/recaptcha/) to add authentication and sign up for sendgrid [here](https://signup.sendgrid.com). Add your site and secret keys from Google and your SENDGRID_KEY, SENDGRID_EMAIl, and SENDGRID_NAME to your appsettings.json. Build the App. Run`Add-Migration InitialPokeVerseSchema -Context PokeVerseDbContext -OutputDir "Data/PokeMigrations"` and then run `Update-Database`. Then run `Add-Migration InitialAuthSchema -Context AuthDbContext -OutputDir "Areas/Identity/Data/Migrations"`. Launch.
